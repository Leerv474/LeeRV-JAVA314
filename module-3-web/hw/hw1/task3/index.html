    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
    <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="formula">ax + b = 0</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are real numbers and <b>x</b> is a variable.
      This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note
      that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the
      variable may or may not by an <b>x</b> so don't get too locked into always
      seeing an x there.
    </p>
    <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <div class="container">
    <p class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      where <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> are known values and <b>x</b> is the
      variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <b>a</b> can't be 0.
    </p>
    <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>
    <p><b>π</b> (Pi) times the radius (<b>r</b>) squared.</p>
    <div class="container">
    <p class="formula">A = π × r<sup>2</sup></p>
    </div>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<b>D</b>):</p>
    <div class="container">
    <p class="formula">A = (π / 4) × D<sup>2</sup></p>
    </div>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<b>C</b>):</p>
    <div class="container">
    <p class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> / (π × 4)</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Intersection</h4>
    <p>
      The intersection of two sets <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, denoted by A ∩ B, is
      the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In
      symbols,
    </p>
    <div class="container">
    <p class="formula">A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      That is, <b>x</b> is an element of the intersection A ∩ B if and only if
      <b>x</b> is both an element of <b>A</b> and an element of <b>B</b>.
