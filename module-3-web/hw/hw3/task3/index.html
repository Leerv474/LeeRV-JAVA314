          <h2>TAG</h2>
          <p>
            In information systems, a tag is a keyword or term assigned to a
            piece of information (such as an Internet bookmark, digital image,
            database record, or computer file). THis kind of metadata helps
            describe an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or
            searching.
            <sup>[1]</sup>
            Tags are generally chosen informally and personally by the item's
            creator or by its viewer, depending on the system, although they may
            also be chosen from a controlled vocabulary.<sup>[2]</sup>

          <h2>ATTRIBUTE</h2>
          <p>
            HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to
            control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of
            an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default
            functionality of an element type or provides functionality to
            certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In
            HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.

          <h2>ELEMENT</h2>
          <p>
            An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML (Hypertext
            Markup Language) document or web page.[vague] HTML is composed of a
            tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node can have HTML
            attributes specified. Nodes can also have content, including other
            nodes and text. Many HTML nodes represent semantics, or meaning. For
            example, the &lt;title&gt; node represents the title of the
            document.

          Some users, however, see tags not as metadata but as "just more

          metadata, but 'just more content' - to some people" (PDF). Proceedings
